# Hack Your Brain with Bash
Bash script designed to automate your discipline. It's simple: make good habits inevitable and bad habits difficult. Inspired by the book "Atomic Habits" from James Clear.

## Philosophy
"Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits." – James Clear

This script is a practical application of that concept. It's not just about blocking sites; it's about reinforcing the identity you want to build. Every challenge completed is a vote for your new self.

Make this script a cornerstone of your daily routine. Let it guide you back to work, away from distractions, and towards the person you aim to be.

"Systems are the engines of success. Build a system that makes your good habits the path of least resistance." – James Clear

Start hacking habits with bash.

## Ready to go
- **Zen Mode Activation**: Launch the script, and your digital space instantly enters Zen Mode. All messengers, social media, and news sites are silenced and unaccessible. 
- **Controlled News Access**: Crave a news update? Command `hack switch news`, conquer a few challenges—mantras and push-ups—and earn a 10-minute news window. Need more time? Extend to 20 minutes with `hack switch news 20`. But that's your limit; discipline is non-negotiable.
- **Default to Zen**: The script's bias is towards Zen Mode, nudging you back to a state of undisturbed productivity.
- **Clear Mode**: For moments requiring unbounded access, `clear` mode lifts all barriers for up to 10 minutes
