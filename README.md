# Hack Your Brain with Bash: Program Your Habits

Inspired by James Clear's "Atomic Habits," this hackable Bash script is your toolkit for programming your brain to build better habits.

## Commands

- **Zen Mode**: `hack switch zen` - Blocks out the digital clutter.
- **News Timer**: `hack switch news` - Earn your news time.
- **Default Zen**: Keeps you on the path of focus.
- **Clear Mode**: `clear` - Momentary freedom when needed.
- **Work Mode**: `hack switch work` - Only the essentials for work.

## Atomic Habits Principles

This script is a practical application of the principles from "Atomic Habits":

- **Cue Elimination**: Zen Mode removes the triggers of bad habits.
- **Friction**: Default to Zen simplifies maintaining focus and having to complete challenges increases the friction of bad habits.
- **Identity Reinforcement**: Each use is a vote for the person you're becoming.
  "Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become." – James Clear
